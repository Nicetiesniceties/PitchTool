# A little pitch sensing html template
> This is just a prototype website that I use when litsen and write down some youtube music, including pitch sensing, note sheet writing, and youtube streaming.
Generally, all the hard work are done by [cwilso](https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect) and the [VexTab](http://vexflow.com/vextab/) api. I only complete the interface with bootstrap and add some minor js functions.
